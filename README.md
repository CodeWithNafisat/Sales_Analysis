🚀 **Walmart Sales Data Analysis Project** 🚀

I recently completed an in depth exploratory data analysis (EDA) on Walmart's sales data, uncovering valuable insights that can drive key business decisions. By analyzing three months of data (January-March), I identified several critical patterns related to customer behavior, product performance, and branch operations.

### 🔑 **Key Findings:**
- **Product Performance:** Electronic accessories and Food & Beverages emerged as the top performing product categories in terms of total sales.
- **Branch Comparison:** Unique performance trends were observed across branches A, B, and C.
- **Customer Insights:** Explored spending habits and product preferences between members vs. normal customers.
- **Temporal Patterns:** Visualized daily and monthly sales trends using moving averages.
- **Payment Methods:** Analyzed payment method preferences across different customer segments.

### 🛠️ **Technical Skills Demonstrated:**
- **Data Cleaning:** Tackled outliers and ensured data quality for accurate insights.
- **Statistical Analysis:** Applied descriptive statistics to understand sales distributions.
- **Data Visualization:** Created meaningful visualizations using Matplotlib and Seaborn.
- **Time Series Analysis:** Incorporated moving averages to identify emerging sales trends.
- **Categorical Analysis:** Cross-analyzed product performance by branch and customer type.

### 🔧 **Tools & Libraries Used:**
- **Python** (Pandas, NumPy)
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** for insightful visualizations
- **Jupyter Notebook** for an efficient analysis workflow

### 🔜 **What's Next:**
I’m currently building an interactive Streamlit dashboard to make these insights accessible to business stakeholders. The dashboard will enable users to:
- Filter data by time period, product category, and branch
- Compare performance metrics across various dimensions
- Generate dynamic visualizations based on selected parameters
- Export insights for reporting and presentations
